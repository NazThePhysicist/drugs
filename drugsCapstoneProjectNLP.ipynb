    "Since the Bag of Words model is based on absolute term frequency, it can cause issues when dealing with large text corpus as there might be some terms which occur frequently across all documents and these may tend to overshadow other terms in the feature set. \n",
    "We can overcome this problem by using TF-IDF model by using a scaling or normalizing factor in its computation, which uses a combination of two metrics in its computation, namely: term frequency (tf) and inverse document frequency (idf). TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ tf(w, D) represents the term frequency of the word \"w\" in document \"D\", which can be obtained from the Bag of Words model. The term idf(w, D) is the inverse document frequency for the term \"w\", which can be computed as the log transform of the total number of documents in the corpus \"C\" divided by the document frequency of the word \"w\", which is basically the frequency of documents in the corpus where the word \"w\" occurs. There are multiple variants of this model but they all end up giving quite similar results. Let’s apply this on our corpus now!"

    "Pairwise document similarity in a corpus involves computing document similarity for each pair of documents in a corpus. Thus if you have C documents in a corpus, you would end up with a C x C matrix such that each row and column represents the similarity score for a pair of documents, which represent the indices at the row and column, respectively. There are several similarity and distance metrics that are used to compute document similarity. These include cosine distance/similarity, euclidean distance, manhattan distance, BM25 similarity, jaccard distance and so on. One of the most popular and widely used similarity metric, cosine similarity is used in the following cell and we can compare pairwise document similarity based on their TF-IDF feature vectors.\n"
